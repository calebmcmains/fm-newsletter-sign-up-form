## Overview

This was a good project to work on and grow front end skills. It is desktop and mobile friendly. I took a desktop first approach and then adapted it to mobile. I went with vite+react as my framework and tailwind CSS to style.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
